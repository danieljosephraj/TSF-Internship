# TSF-Internship

Graduate Rotational Internship Program by The Sparks Foundation 

As a Data Science and Business Analytics Intern at the Sparks Foundation, I have completed the following tasks using Python Programming Language in Jupyter Notebook and stored them here. 

Task 1: Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
Predict the percentage of a student based on the number of hours they study per day using Simple Linear Regression technique on the student marks dataset. Also predict the score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs./ day?

Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning
From the given "Iris" dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters (i.e., K) and represent it visually.
